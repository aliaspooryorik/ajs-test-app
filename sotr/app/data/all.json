In this dynamic session, master trainer Mark Lassoff will invite participants to code along as he develops a full app using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and the PhoneGap library. The app will be ready-for-release for iOS, Android and even Windows 8.

We’ve all been there; tasked with a change, which as optimistic developers we say won’t take us long, weeks later we’re still fighting the system. Enter the Mikado Method, a way to peel the layers of complexity away from any system. Systematically attack refactoring, in the knowledge that every change you make will be for the better of the system, rather than hoping it will be. When it comes to refactoring legacy systems, sometimes it faster just to get in there and naively attempt to make the change required rather than speed weeks analysing the affects. Naively making the change will always have knock on affects to other parts of the system. It is these knock on affects that cause what we believe to be quick changes to become large, long drawn out changes. With the Mikado Method, your system will always be runnable while you refactor, say goodbye to the feature branches of refactoring, and hello to a runnable testable system all the time. Fix one issue at a time, and keep your system deliverable at all times. The method also works when it comes to implementing new features or fixing bugs in a system, there are always side effects when we need to change code. The Mikado Method will help in all these situations. In a nut shell, it's Red, Green, Refactor on a large scale. A way to safely start paying back your technical debt.","track":null,"oldTrack":null,"AssociatedCompanies":[],"reviews":{"default":{"object":{"id":0,"agendum_id":"29607","company_event_id":null,"question_type":1,"question":"How did you like this?","possible_answers":null},"stats":{"votes":"0","results":"0.0000"}}}},{"id":"29610","event_id":"86040","updated":"1364488006","created":"1362756127","AgendaStartTime":"1370520600","AgendaEndTime":"1370523600","review_override":"3","AgendaName":"Quit your boring 9-5er","AgendaHost":null,"AgendaLoc":"The Adobe Room","AgendaCost":"","AgendaDesc":"As web professionals, we have highly sought-after skills and expertise.

It’s about how we should all be approaching localisation challenges as people problems and to give good examples of how to get it right and where you can go so very wrong. Your framework and tool of choice is the easy part – understanding the people you’re wanting to each out to is oh-so-very hard and too often seen as only just a translation problem – a simple matter of swapping one string for another. I’ll talk about how people communicate across cultures, even when they are so different. Drawing on my experience as a teacher of english as a foreign language and my own travels and struggles to absorb another people’s language and culture, I hope I’ll change how you think about solving these problems in future. Hell, I’ll even make you laugh. I hope. The most important thing though, I’ll provoke a discussion; it could be a very good one.","track":null,"oldTrack":null,"AssociatedCompanies":[],"reviews":{"default":{"object":{"id":0,"agendum_id":"29633","company_event_id":null,"question_type":1,"question":"How did you like this?","possible_answers":null},"stats":{"votes":"0","results":"0.0000"}}}},{"id":"30900","event_id":"86040","updated":"1363970019","created":"1363970018","AgendaStartTime":"1370614200","AgendaEndTime":"1370617200","review_override":"3","AgendaName":"\"It doesn't work\" doesn't work - how to help others help you.","AgendaHost":null,"AgendaLoc":"Room 2","AgendaCost":"","AgendaDesc":"All developers have times when they need to ask their peers for help, but this can be a daunting task - sometimes knowing what and how to ask is as difficult as the problem itself - and it doesn't help when you're stressed out and get slapped down (or ignored) for not knowing how to present your question. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can check against, to help you frame your question more appropriately (and maybe even solve your problem before you've even asked).
